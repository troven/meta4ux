meta4ux
-------

meta4ux is a front-end framework to facilitate "UI as a Service". It's a JSON vocabularly that embraces the MVVM design pattern.

You describe what you want to achieve, and let meta4 worry about the 'how'.

Our goal is to help non-tech entrepreneurs but also DBAs, BAs, DevOps, etc to create responsive, feature-rich apps, prototypes, MVPs or intranet databases that target both mobiles and desktops.

meta4 helps you to experiment, test hypotheses and iterate towards product/market fit before investing too much into hard-baked software.

In essence, meta4 embodies a declarative approach to constructing software by favouring JSON over code.
